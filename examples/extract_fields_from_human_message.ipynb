    "Think of the \"Instruction\" as similar to a \"System Prompt\" in other LLM applications.\n",

    "- We've provided an example `fetch` function that we utilize to make an asynchronous POST request to the Inflection AI API.\n",
    "- We're using the `parse_xml_response` function to parse the XML response from the Inflection AI API. We've found best results using this approach to get consistent results since there is not a \"guaranteed JSON\" mode for the Inflection AI API (yet!).\n",
